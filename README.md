# FreeRTOS example for CH32F208WB

This project is modified example from Nanjing Qinheng Microelectronics (WCH; manufacturer).

Manufacturer example project was originally made for Keil uVision5. It was converted using [Keil2GCC](https://github.com/embedded-tools/keil2gcc) converter ((c)2018 Ondrej Sterba) to support GCC compiler. The resulting files were fixed (mainly addresses in liner script).
